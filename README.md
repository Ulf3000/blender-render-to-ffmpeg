# blender-render-to-ffmpeg-prores-cineform-
a small script to render to a cineform or prores quicktime (or whatever floats your boat lol) with the help of ffmpeg

its just a script, not an addon, its hardcoded to my needs but everyone should be able to create his own favourite render script from this. 

its rendering to intermediate png in a temp folder and then uses ffmpeg to convert it to a cineform quicktime file in the real output folder as chosen in blender.
